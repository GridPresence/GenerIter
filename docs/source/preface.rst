A Few Words From One Creator Of The GenerIter
---------------------------------------------
By Thomas Park, 10th Feb 2021

It is now time to deploy the GenerIter, and I wanted to share some thoughts with folks.

My name is Thomas Park-- the GenerIter was originally a console Python application called “RoboDJ”. I created the application to help me with composing music-- I was tired of some of the hard labor of trimming and preparing samples, only to combine them in all of the familiar ways.

I went to Python to help, which is a language I learned in a Launchcode code camp in 2018.

While creating the original code, I made some breakthroughs-- perhaps the most exciting was when the code could literally create and output thousands of tracks per hour. As neat as that was, I was aware that I had stepped on some folk’s shoes.

There are those who disavow all of Modern Art as a waste. There are many who do not love technology, and shun its use. And there are some who feel that music made largely by a processor must be bad and harmful to this world.

Sadly, the weekend of this release, my Mother appears to be dying, with little hope of recovery, due to a number of causes. She did not love hospitals, and in her 70s, did not have even a checkup for her last seven years. As a result, when they finally had her in to treat her for Covid, they found symptom after symptom of other issues-- too many, alas, for a favorable diagnosis.

We live in a changing world, and when we need help, I feel that we should ask for it. I know that my Mother did not approve of my recent coding and musical developments. I did not approve of her lack of care. There was no lack of love, only understanding.

The GenerIter, so well-developed by Jeremy Pavier, already does more than I expected it to, and better. I cannot thank him enough for working so many hours at no charge to help achieve this dream. I would say it has also become his.

This tool goes with sadness, too, out to my mother, a lovely woman who will never understand what it does, will never approve of it, or anything like it. Sad but true that the world moves on without us, regardless of our feelings. I choose to embrace the future, and try to make it better.

And I hope that this Module comes to enhance the lives of many, easing a process that can be unnecessarily complex, and opening the doors to new sounds and new combinations.

Thank you for your time,
Thomas Park
Co-creator of the GenerIter
